Scripts to run as CWL with two workflow managers:
* [Rabix](https://rabix.io/).  Rabix Executor is no longer maintained but still serves as a lightweight local reference
* [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).  Developed individually for MGI and compute1 environments at WUSTL

Development here is in conjunction of that in Pindel_GermlineCaller, GATK_GermlineCaller, Varscan_GermlineCaller
